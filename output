Si5351A detected at address 0x60.

=== Clock Gen Click CLI ===
Commands:
 init                 - Initialize Si5351A
 set <clk> <freq>     - Set CLK0–CLK2 to a specific frequency (e.g. set 0 1000000)
 on <clk>             - Enable clock output (CLK0–2)
 off <clk>            - Disable clock output (CLK0–2)
 read <reg>           - Read value of a register (e.g. read 0)
 status               - Show status register (0x00)
 exit                 - Exit CLI

>> init
